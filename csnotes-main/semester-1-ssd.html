    <button class="faq__question">What are the tips to enhancing the Personality?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        ▪ Smile a lot- Nothing works better than a big smile when it comes to interacting with people around. Do
        not forget to flash your trillion dollar smile quite often. Believe me, it works! As they say “a smile is a
        curve that sets everything straight”. A smiling face wins even the toughest soul. Wear your smile while
        <br><br>
        interacting with others. Smile not only helps in enhancing an individual's personality but also winning
        other's heart. <br><br>
        ▪ Think positive- It is really essential to think positive. Remember there is light at the end of every dark
        tunnel. Do not always think negative as it not only acts as a demotivating factor but also makes an
        individual dull and frustrated. Don't get upset over minor things. Be a little flexible and always look at
        the broader perspectives of life. <br><br>
        ▪ Dress Sensibly- Dressing sensibly and smartly go a long way in honing one's personality. One needs
        to dress according to the occasion. How would a female look if she wears a sari to a discotheque?
        Obviously ridiculous! No matter how expensive your sari is, you can't wear it to a night club or a pub
        where everyone is dressed in smart casuals. Price has nothing to do with smart dressing. An individual
        who is well dressed is respected and liked by all. No one would take you seriously if you do not wear
        suitable clothes fitting with occasions. Do take care of the fit of the dress as well. An individual should
        wear clothes as per his/her body type, height, physique and so on. Someone who is bulky would not
        look very impressive in body hugging clothes. It is not necessary that something which looks good on
        your friend would also look good on you. Wear the right make up. You do not have to apply loud make
        up to look good and attractive. Even minimal make up, if applied sensibly can really make you stand
        apart from the rest. <br><br>
        ▪ Be soft-spoken- Do not always find faults in others. Fighting and quarrelling lead to no solution. Be
        polite with others. Be very careful of what you speak. Avoid being rude and short tempered. <br><br>
        ▪ Leave your ego behind- An individual needs to hide his ego everywhere he goes. Be it office or
        workplace you need to leave your ego behind if you wish to win appreciation from others. An individual
        who is good from within is loved by all. <br><br>
        ▪ Help others- Do not always think of harming others. Share whatever you know. Remember no one can
        steal your knowledge. Always help others. <br><br>
        ▪ Confidence- Confidence is the key to a positive personality. Exude confidence and positive aura
        wherever you go. <br><br>
        ▪ A Patient listener- Be a patient listener. Never interrupt when others are speaking. Try to imbibe good
        qualities of others.                                     <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is Johari's Window?</button> <!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        The Johari Window model is a simple and useful tool for illustrating and improving self-awareness,
        and mutual understanding between individuals within a group. This model can also be used to assess and
        improve a group's relationship with other groups. This model is particularly useful in team development.
        It was developed by American psychologists Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham in 1955, hence the name
        Johari. Johari Window is generally used in Self-help groups in exercises which help a person to learn and
        discover things about themselves, like heuristic exercise. Johari Window is a method used for self-discovery.
        <br><br>
        Johari window model is based upon two things - to acquire the trust of others by revealing your information to
        them and by learning about yourself through feedback by others. <br><br>
        1. Open/self-area or arena - Here the information about the person his attitudes, behaviour, emotions,
        feelings, skills and views will be known by the person as well as by others. This is mainly the area where
        all the communications occur and the larger the arena becomes the more effectual and dynamic the
        relationship will be. 'Feedback solicitation' is a process which occurs by understanding and listening to the
        feedback from another person. Through this way the open area can be increased horizontally decreasing the
        blind spot. The size of the arena can also be increased downwards and thus by reducing the hidden and
        unknown areas through revealing one's feelings to other person. <br><br>
        2. Blind self or blind spot - Information about yourselves that others know in a group but you will be
        unaware of it. Others may interpret yourselves differently than you expect. The blind spot is reduced for an
        efficient communication through seeking feedback from others. <br><br>
        3. Hidden area or façade - Information that is known to you but will be kept unknown from others. This
        can be any personal information which you feel reluctant to reveal. This includes feelings, past experiences,
        fears, secrets etc. we keep some of our feelings and information as private as it affects the relationships and
        thus the hidden area must be reduced by moving the information to the open areas. <br><br>
        4. Unknown area - The Information which are unaware to yourselves as well as others. This includes the
        information, feelings, capabilities, talents etc. This can be due to traumatic past experiences or events which
        can be unknown for a lifetime. The person will be unaware till he discovers his hidden qualities and
        capabilities or through observation of others. Open communication is also an effective way to decrease the
        unknown area and thus to communicate effectively. <br><br>
        1.2.6 Communication Skills

        Communication skills are the abilities you use when giving and receiving different kinds of
        information. Communication skills involve listening, speaking, observing and empathising. It is also helpful to
        understand the differences in how to communicate through face-to-face interactions, phone conversations and digital
        communications like email and social media.                                     <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is Non-verbal Comunication and its types?</button> <!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        The Non-Verbal Communication is the process of conveying meaning without the use of words
        either written or spoken. In other words, any communication made between two or more persons through
        the use of facial expressions, hand movements, body language, postures, and gestures is called as non-verbal
        communication. <br><br>
        The Non-Verbal Communication, unlike the verbal communication, helps in establishing and
        maintaining the interpersonal relationships while the verbals only help in communicating the external
        events. People use non-verbals to express emotions and interpersonal attitudes, conduct rituals such as
        greetings and bring forward one's personality.   
        <br><br>
        Types of nonverbal communication are: <br>
          1. Eye contact: Eye contact with audiences increases the speaker's credibility. Teachers who
          make eye contact open the flow of communication and convey interest, concern, warmth,
          and credibility. <br><br>
          2. Facial expressions: The face is an important communicator. It is commonly said that the face is the
          index of the mind. It expresses the type of emotions or feelings such as joy, love, interest, sorrow,
          anger, annoyance, confusion, enthusiasm, fear, hatred surprise, and uncertainty. <br><br>

          3. Movement: The way you move your arms and legs such as walking quickly or slowly, standing,
          sitting or fidgeting, can all convey different messages to onlookers. <br><br>
          4. Posture: The way you sit or stand can also communicate your comfort level,

          professionalism and general disposition towards a person or conversation. <br><br>

          5. Gestures: While gestures vary widely across communities, they are generally used both
          intentionally and unintentionally to convey information to others. <br><br>
          6. Space: Creating or closing distance between yourself and the people around you can also
          convey messages about your comfort level, the importance of the conversation, your
          desire to support or connect with others and more. <br><br>
          7. Paralanguage: Paralanguage includes the non-language elements of speech, such as your
          talking speed, pitch, intonation, volume and more. <br><br>
          8. Facial expressions: One of the most common forms of nonverbal communication is facial
          expressions. Using the eyebrows, mouth, eyes and facial muscles to convey can be very
          effective when communicating both emotion and information. <br><br>
          9. Eye contact: Strategically using eye content (or lack of eye contact) is an extremely
          effective way to communicate your attention and interest. <br><br>
          10. Touch: Some people also use touch as a form of communication. Most commonly, it is used
          to communicate support or comfort. This form of communication should be used 
          sparingly and only when you know the receiving party is okay with it. It should never be
          used to convey anger, frustration or any other negative emotions. <br><br>
          1.2.7 Physical Fitness
          Physical fitness is an important component to leading a healthy lifestyle. It helps one to
          maintain fitness, develop muscular strength and improve cardiovascular health. A regular
          fitness activity improves the absorption of nutrients by the body, improves digestive
          processes and increases physiological processes.                                   <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What are the Components of Emotional Intelligence?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        1. Self-awareness: This is the ability to recognise and understand personal moods, emotions and
        drives and the effect of them on both self and others. Self-awareness depends on one’s ability to
        monitor one's own emotional state and to correctly identify and name the emotions being felt.
        Developing this ability is essential for realistic self-assessment and builds self-confidence and the
        ability to take oneself less seriously. <br><br>
        2. Self-regulation: This is the ability to control or re- direct disruptive emotional impulses and moods.
        It involves the ability to suspend judgement and delay action to allow time for thought. From a
        neuroscientific perspective, you can frequently observe this skill, or lack of it, by watching response
        times. If an angry client is in rapid-fire mode responding to what you say in less than about half a
        second then it is very likely that they are not giving conscious thought to what is being said to them.
        Those with this ability will frequently demonstrate trustworthiness, integrity, comfort, with
        ambiguity and openness to change. <br><br>
        3. Internal motivation: Frequently seen within veterinary professionals, internal motivation is about
        working with and for an inner vision of what is important, a curiosity and desire for learning and
        development, a drive that goes beyond external rewards such as money or status. There is often a
        strong drive to achieve, optimism even in the face of failure and organisational commitment. There
        are also risks, particularly in the presence of an undue sense of perfectionism. <br><br>
        4. Empathy: This relates to the ability to understand the emotional make-up of others and the skill to
        treat people according to their emotional reactions. It includes skills in building and maintaining
        relationships with those we come into contact with on a daily basis. Though central to a service
        profession, empathy can tend to be somewhat less well developed in those with an isolated
        background and an intensive / competitive scientific training. Empathy often does, but does not
        necessarily, imply compassion; it can be used for both good and bad. <br><br>
        5. Social skills: This involves the ability to manage relationships, build networks, find common ground
        and build rapport. It will often help when leading change, being persuasive, building expertise and
        getting great performance from teams.                                     <!--Answer-->

    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        1. RECOGNIZE YOUR EMOTIONS AND NAME THEM
        What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what
        emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and
        reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral
        step toward EI. <br><br>
        2. ASK FOR FEEDBACK
        Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate
        your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how

        adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want
        to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear. <br><br>
        3. READ LITERATURE
        Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories
        from other people's perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may
        help enhance your social awareness.                                     <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is GSC's 3M Model of Communication?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        In order to explain the process of communication, GSC has developed 3M Model. The 3M are
        Message, Media, and Meaning. <br><br>
        ➢ Message: A message may consist of the sounds, words, or behaviours in a communication
        interaction. The message itself is transmitted through a channel, the pathway or route for
        communication, to a receiver, who is the target or recipient of the message. There may be obstacles in
        the communication process, or noise. Noise refers to any interference in the channel or distortion of the
        message. This is a fairly simple model in which a message is simply passed from sender to receiver. <br><br>
        ➢ Media: This means of communication. Following types of media are used for communication.
        • Radio: Traditional radio and digital equivalents such as podcasts.
        
        • Video: Video and film based content such as television, movies, promotional videos, commercials and
        video-sharing websites.
        • Publications: Publications such as books, magazines, newspapers, blogs and research papers. <br>
        • Social Media: Digital tools that allow people to communicate and share and produce content. <br>
        • Messaging: Traditional mail and digital messaging tools such as email and messaging apps. <br>
        • Digital Communication: Forums, chats and other tools that allow people to socialize, share information
        and form communities. <br>
        • Games: Digital games and virtual environments. <br>
        • Applications: Applications a general term for software that people use including mobile apps. <br>
        • Graphics: Graphics such as signs, billboards, digital advertising, t-shirts and product packaging. <br>
        • Public Speaking: Speaking directly to groups of people often with visual aids such as graphics, slides
        and video. <br>
        • Art & Music: Art displayed in public and musical performance. <br>
        • Performance: Theatre and other performance such as dance. <br><br>
        ➢ Meaning:
        Meaningful communication is a skill set and it can be developed with both practice and courage.
        Making real change to a communication style is a long- term project. Such change may require frequent
        effortful reorientation of attention and conversational habits. However, the goals of meaningful
        communication, which include gaining emotional connection and depth, can make this challenge truly
        worthwhile.                                    <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is a Resume and Curriculum Vitae?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
            <b>Resume</b>
            What is a resume, and why do you need one when you are job searching? A resume is a written
          document of your education, work experience, credentials, and accomplishments. Mostly all professional
          positions require applicants to submit a resume and cover letter as part of the recruitment process.
          Your resume is the first document a hiring manager will look at when reviewing your job application.
          Hence “first impression.” Which you create in the mind of the employer, which needs to be impressive.
          Well planned and well written resume suggest that you meet all the requirements for the position
          you are applying for and you deserve an interview call. The ultimate aim of any resume is to earn an
          interview call. The best resume is the one that enables the prospective employer to know everything about
          the job applicant the shortest possible time. Ideally, 15 to 20 seconds of resume reading, your prospective
          employer should know who you are? So, the real challenge in resume writing life is presenting all the
          information, concerning a job aspirant through a neat, simple and concise method.
          Resume is like you're sale statement in which you are promoting yourself. A clear print resume will
          cut through the competition and get you the much awaited job call.  
          <br><br>
          <b>Curriculum Vitae</b>
          A CV, also known as curriculum vitae or we take that means the course of life in Latin. CV is a
          complete sketch of your accomplishments in the arena of education employment research and University
          engagement. In the USA, CV is mostly used to present a person's academic status and achievement. What
          academic appointments you hold with research projects you work on and etc. CV is usually longer than the
          rays you and it may run into more than three pages depending on your profile. Broadly a CV is a reflection
          of your scholarly identity while your resume construct your professional identity.                               <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What are the some types of Interview?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        Behavioral Interviews <br>
        Interviewers use behavioral based interviews to determine how you've handled various job
        situations in the past. The idea is that your past behavior predicts how you'll act in the new job. You won’t
        get many easy “yes” or “no” questions and in most cases, you'll need to answer with an anecdote about a
        previous experience. <br><br>
        Case Interviews <br>
        Interviews that include the interviewer giving you a business scenario and asking you to manage the
        situation are called case interviews. They're most often used in management consulting and investment
        banking interviews and require you to show off your analytical ability and problem-solving skills. <br><br>
        Competency Based Interviews <br>
        Interviews that require you to give examples of specific skills are called competency-based
        interviews, or job specific interviews. The interviewer will ask questions that will help them determine if
        you have the knowledge and skills required for the specific job. <br><br>
        Exit Interviews <br>
        An exit interview is a meeting between an employee who has resigned or been terminated and the
        company's Human Resources department. Companies conduct these types of interviews, so they can learn
        more about the work environment and get job feedback. You may be asked why you left your job, why are
        you taking a new job, and what would you change about your job. These tips will help you handle an exit
        interview so you can move on gracefully. <br><br>
        Final Interview <br>
        The final interview is the last step in the interview process and the last interview you find out
        whether or not you'll get a job offer. This type of interview is usually conducted by the CEO or other
        members of upper management. The key to a final interview is to take it as seriously as all the preliminary
        interviews — just because you were asked in for a final interview doesn't mean you got the job yet. <br><br>
        Group Interviews <br>
        Employers may hold group interviews because they're often more efficient than one-on-one
        interviews. There are two types of group interviews: one involves an applicant being interviewed by a group
        (or panel) of interviewers; the other involves one interviewer and a group of applicants. <br><br>
        Informal Interviews <br>
        Hiring managers may begin the screening process with a relaxed, informal conversation instead of
        a formal interview. This is more of a casual discussion than a typical job interview. On a similar note, a chat
        over a cup of coffee is another less formal type of job interview. <br><br>
        Informational Interviews <br>
        An informational interview is used to collect information about a job, career field, industry or
        company. In this case, you're the interviewer and you find people to speak with so you can learn more about
        a specific field. <br><br>
        Mock Interviews <br>
        A mock interview provides you with an opportunity to practice for an interview and receive
        feedback. Although you can do an informal mock interview with a friend of family member, a mock
        interview with a career coach, counselor or university career office will give the best feedback.                                    <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is the Six Thinking Hat Method?</button><!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        1. Blue hat <br>
        The blue hat represents control: setting the focus, defining the problem and shaping the questions.
        This hat can be worn in the beginning of the meeting. It is also the only hat that can be worn during the
        whole meeting, but only by one person, the facilitator that is leading the meeting. <br><br>
        2. White hat <br>
        When the white hat is worn the focus is neutral and objective information; what information you
        have, need or miss. <br><br>
        3. Red hat <br>
        Wearing the red hat gives you an opportunity to express feelings, emotions and intuition without

        any need to explain or justify them. <br><br>
        4. Black hat <br>
        When critical thinking is needed, the black hat is put on. This hat is the hat of caution and survival. <br><br>
        5. Yellow hat <br>
        The yellow hat calls for optimism and covers hope and positive thinking. Yellow hat thinking is
        constructive and generative. <br><br>
        6. Green hat <br>
        For creative thinking and new ideas the green hat is put on. Under this hat options and ideas are laid out,
        modified and improved.                                     <!--Answer-->
