  <button class="faq__question">What is calculus?</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change, in the same way that geometry deals
      with the study of shape and algebra deals with the study of operations and their application to solving equations.
      Calculus is divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. 
      calculus can be used in the design and analysis of algorithms for optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points or maximizing the profits of a company. 
      Calculus can also be used in the study of machine learning, where it is used to derive and analyze algorithms for fitting models to data and making predictions.

  <button class="faq__question">What are derivatives?</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      In calculus, a derivative is a measure of how much a function changes as its input changes. It is a fundamental concept that is used to characterize the local behavior of a function near a point.

      The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is denoted by f'(x) or df/dx and is defined as the limit:
      
      f'(x) = lim(h->0) [(f(x+h) - f(x)) / h]
      
      The derivative measures the slope of the function's graph at a given point, and can be thought of as the "instantaneous rate of change" of the function at that point.
      
      Derivatives are used to study the behavior of functions, to optimize their performance, and to understand how small changes in their inputs can lead to large changes in their outputs. 
     They are a fundamental tool in calculus and have numerous applications in science, engineering, economics, and other fields.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="faq__question">Application of derivatives in computer science.</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      Derivatives, which are a fundamental concept in calculus, can be applied in several areas of computer science. One application of derivatives is in the optimization of algorithms,
     where they can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem by identifying the direction in which a function is changing most rapidly and adjusting the parameters of the algorithm accordingly.

     Derivatives can also be used in machine learning, where they are used to optimize the parameters of a model so as to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.
      For example, in the case of a neural network, the derivatives of the error function with respect to the model's weights can be used to update the weights in a way that minimizes the error.
     
     In addition to these applications, derivatives can also be used in computer graphics, where they are used to smooth out the jagged edges of curves and surfaces and to create more realistic images. 
     They can also be used in the analysis of data, where they can be used to identify patterns and trends that might not be immediately apparent.

  <button class="faq__question">What is Zeno's Paradox?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      Zeno's Paradox is a set of philosophical problems in ancient Greece proposed by Zeno of Elea. These paradoxes are intended to show that motion is an illusion and that reality is static and unchanging. <br> Zeno used these paradoxes to challenge the beliefs of his time that motion, change, and plurality were real.
      <br> <br>
      One of the most famous examples of Zeno's Paradox is: <br> <br>
      Suppose you wanted to travel a distance of one mile. Before you can reach the one-mile mark, you must first travel half the distance, which is half a mile. But before you can travel half a mile, you must first travel a quarter of a mile. And so on, indefinitely.
      <br><br>
      By breaking the distance to be covered into an infinite number of finite segments, Zeno argues that it is impossible to ever reach the one-mile mark. Because an infinite number of finite segments will always be left, there will always be an infinite number of distances left to travel. Therefore, motion is impossible, and the traveler will never arrive at the one-mile mark.
      <br><br>
      This example of Zeno's Paradox is meant to show that motion and change are not real but rather are only illusions. It suggests that the concept of motion is not straightforward, but it is a series of an infinite number of static moments that can never be reached.

  <button class="faq__question">What is limits in calculus?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      In calculus, the limit of the sine function as the input (x) approaches a certain value (a) is the value that the sine function approaches as x gets arbitrarily close to a, but never equals it. It is represented mathematically as:
        <br> <br>
     <code>lim(sin(x), x->a) = L</code>
<br><br>
This means that as x gets closer and closer to a, the value of sin(x) gets arbitrarily close to L, but never equals L.                                   <!--Answer-->

   <button class="faq__question">What is a neighbourhood of a point?</button><!--Question-->
   <div class="faq__panel">
     <p class="faq__answer">
      In calculus, a neighbourhood of a point is a small interval or region around that point. It is used to study the behavior of a function in the vicinity of that point. For example, if we are studying the behavior of a function f(x)
       at a point x = a, we can define a neighbourhood around that point as an interval (a-h, a+h) for some small value of h. This interval can be used to study the behavior of the function in the vicinity of x = a.
         <br><br>
      For example, if we want to study the behavior of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point x = 0, we can define a neighbourhood around that point as the interval (-h, h) for some small value of h. By studying the behavior of the function 
      within this interval, we can determine if the function is increasing, decreasing, or has a local minimum or maximum at x = 0.                                   <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
         <b> The Epsilon-Delta definition of a limit is a precise way to define what it means for a function to approach a certain value as the input (x) approaches a certain value (a).
        It is a formal definition that allows us to determine if a limit exists and what value the limit is.</b>
       <br> <br>
 The definition states that given a function f(x) and a value L, we can say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written as: 
<br><br>
<code>lim(f(x), x->a) = L</code>
<br><br>
if for any positive number ε (epsilon), there exists a corresponding positive number δ (delta) such that for all x, if 0 <code>< |x - a| < δ</code> , then <code>|f(x) - L| < ε</code>. 
<br><br>
 In simple words, it states that as x gets arbitrarily close to a, the value of f(x) also gets arbitrarily close to L, but never equals L. The ε and δ are chosen so that the difference between f(x) and L is less than ε, as long as x is within δ of a.
<br><br>
 This definition allows us to say that a function approaches a certain value as the input gets closer and closer to a certain value. It is a way to mathematically check if a limit exists and what is the value of the limit. It provides us a precise way to define the limit of a function, making it a fundamental concept in Calculus.                                   <!--Answer-->
        <br><br>
        Imagine you have a function f(x) and you want to know what happens to the output of the function as the input x gets closer and closer
           to a certain value (a), called the limit. <br> The epsilon-delta definition says that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L if you can make the output of the function as close to L as you want by making x close enough to a.

      The epsilon-delta definition is like a game between two players, you and the function. The function gives you an output for any x you choose, and you can choose the x to be as close to a as you want.
        <br> The function wins the game if it can always give you an output that is close enough to L, no matter how close to a you choose x to be. The definition says that if the function can always win, then the limit of the function is L.
        <br><br>
        Ε(epsilon) is a number that represents how close is close enough to L. The smaller the ε, the closer to L the output of the function must be.
          Δ(delta) is the number that represents how close to a, you can choose x to be. The smaller the δ, the closer to a you can choose x to be.

    <button class="faq__question">What is a Continous Function? When a function said to be Continuous?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        A continuous function in calculus is a function that has no abrupt jumps or breaks in its graph and its output changes smoothly as its input changes. In mathematical terms, a function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as the input approaches the point exists and is equal to the value of the function at that point.
        <br><br>
        The Function will said Continous when they meet following conditions:
        1. The function is defined at the point "a".
  
  2. The limit of the function as x approaches "a" exists and is equal to the value of the function at "a". <br><br>
  
  3. The function has no abrupt jumps or breaks in its graph near the point "a", meaning that it is smooth and the output changes smoothly as the input changes near "a". <br><br>
  
  If a function satisfies these three conditions at a point "a", it is considered to be continuous at that point.

    <button class="faq__question">What is Derivative of a function?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        In calculus, the derivative of a function is a measure of how the function changes as its input changes. It represents the rate of change of the function at a given point. The derivative can be thought of as the slope of the function's tangent line at a specific point. <br><br>
  
  The derivative can be calculated using the limit definition or by using rules and formulas from differentiation. It is a fundamental concept in calculus and is widely used in fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and many others. <br><br>
  
  In general, the derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is denoted as f'(x) or d/dx(f(x)). The derivative provides important information about the behavior of a function, such as its local maxima and minima, concavity, and asymptotes.

    <button class="faq__question">What is Increasing,Decreasing and a Constant function?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        In calculus, a function is said to be: <br><br>
  
  Increasing on an interval if for all x and y in the interval, x < y implies f(x) < f(y), meaning that as x increases, so does f(x). <br><br>
  
  Decreasing on an interval if for all x and y in the interval, x < y implies f(x) > f(y), meaning that as x increases, f(x) decreases. <br><br>
  
  A constant function if for all x in the domain, f(x) = k, where k is a constant, meaning that the value of the function does not change as x varies. <br><br>
  
  These concepts are important in determining the local maxima and minima of a function, as well as its overall behavior on different intervals. <br><br>
