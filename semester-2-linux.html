  <button class="faq__question">What is operating system(OS) ? </button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.
       The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system. Users interact with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command line or a graphical user interface (GUI).
      <br>
      The operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing system requests, controlling input and output devices, facilitating networking, and managing file systems.
       Some examples of popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

  </div>
  <button class="faq__question">
   How linux OS is different from MS's Windows OS? 
  </button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      Linux and Windows are both operating systems that are used to manage the hardware and software resources of a computer. However, there are several key differences between the two.

      One of the main differences is that Linux is an open-source operating system, while Windows is proprietary. This means that the source code of a Linux operating system is freely available and can be modified by anyone, while the source code of a Windows operating system is proprietary and is not publicly available.
      <br><br>
      Another difference is that Linux is generally considered to be more stable and secure than Windows, due in part to the fact that it is open-source and the source code can be reviewed by a large community of developers. In addition, Linux is less susceptible to viruses and other types of malware, although it is not completely immune.
      
      There are also differences in the user interfaces of the two operating systems. Linux generally has a command-line interface, although it can also include a graphical user interface (GUI), while Windows has a GUI as its primary interface.
      
      Finally, Linux and Windows are used for different purposes. Linux is often used as a server operating system, while Windows is more commonly used as a desktop operating system for personal computers.      
      
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="faq__question">Why Linux used as server OS ?</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      Linux is a popular choice for use as a server operating system for a number of reasons. One reason is that it is a free, open-source operating system, which means that it can be freely downloaded and modified by anyone. This makes it an attractive option for organizations that want to use a server OS but do not want to pay for a proprietary one.
<br>
Another reason that Linux is popular as a server OS is that it is highly customizable and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an organization. It also has a large user community, which means that there is a wealth of online resources and support available for users.
<br>
In addition, Linux is known for its stability, security, and performance, making it well-suited for use in a server environment where these factors are important. It can also run on a wide range of hardware, including both mainframe and commodity hardware, which makes it a flexible choice for organizations with diverse hardware needs.

  <button class="faq__question">What is the difference in a local user creates a file in /tmp and in his home directory?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      When a local user creates a file in the /tmp directory, it is created with the permissions of the user who created it, but it is accessible by other users on the system as well, since /tmp is typically a world-readable and world-writable directory. On the other hand, when a user creates a file in their home directory, it is created with the user's permissions and is only accessible by the owner of the file, unless the owner explicitly changes the permissions. This provides an additional layer of security as the user's home directory typically contains sensitive information.                                     <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">Explain run levels in Linux.?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      In Linux, run levels are a way of determining the state of the operating system and what system processes should be running. There are seven standard run levels, each representing a different state of the system: <br><br>

      0 - Halt: The system is shut down and powered off.  <br><br>
      1 - Single User Mode: Only the root user can log in and access the system. <br><br>
      2 - Multi-User Mode (without networking): Allows multiple users to log in, but networking is disabled. <br><br>
      3 - Multi-User Mode (with networking): Allows multiple users to log in and networking is enabled. <br><br>
      4 - Unused: This run level is typically not used. <br><br>
      5 - Multi-User Mode with GUI: Allows multiple users to log in and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) environment. <br><br>
      6 - Reboot: The system is shut down and then restarted. <br><br>
      
      In Linux, the default run level is usually set to 3, which provides a multi-user environment with networking capabilities. The system's run level is determined by the contents of the /etc/inittab file or the symlink at /etc/systemd/system/default.target, depending on the init system being used.                                   <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question"> Differentiate between Linux Kernel and distribution.?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing system resources, such as memory, processes, and input/output operations, and provides a stable interface between the hardware and software components of the system. The Linux kernel is maintained by a team of developers and is released under the GPL (GNU General Public License) open-source license. <br><br>

A Linux distribution, on the other hand, is a packaged version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel and additional software components, such as system libraries, utilities, and applications. There are many different Linux distributions available, each with its own unique features and design goals. Examples of popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS. <br><br>

In summary, the Linux kernel is the underlying foundation of the Linux operating system, while a Linux distribution is a complete and packaged version of the operating system, including the kernel and other software components.                                     <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question"> Give the steps for boot process in Linux.?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      The boot process in Linux typically consists of the following steps:

      1. BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) Startup: The BIOS performs a basic system check and initializes the hardware components, including the keyboard, mouse, and display. It then searches for bootable media, such as a hard drive or CD-ROM, and loads the boot loader. <br><br>
      
     2. Boot Loader: The boot loader is a small program that is responsible for loading the operating system into memory and starting the boot process. Common boot loaders for Linux include GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) and LILO (LInux LOader). The boot loader presents a menu of available operating systems and allows the user to choose which one to boot. <br><br>
      
    3. Kernel Loading: Once the boot loader has located and loaded the Linux kernel, it passes control to the kernel, which begins to initialize the system and start the various system services. <br><br>
      
    4.  Initial RAM Disk (initrd): The initrd is a small, temporary file system that is used by the kernel to load necessary drivers for the system's hardware, such as disk controllers, before the real file system can be mounted. <br><br>
      
    5.  Mounting the Root File System: The root file system contains the core files and directories required for the operation of the system, and it is mounted at boot time. Once the root file system is mounted, the kernel starts the init process, which is responsible for starting other system services and processes. <br><br>
      
    6.  Starting System Services: The init process starts system services, such as the network stack, the system log daemon, and the graphical user interface, in a predetermined order. <br><br>
      
    7. Login Prompt: Once the system services have started, the boot process is complete, and the system is ready for use. A login prompt is displayed, allowing the user to log in to the system and start using it. <br><br>
      
      This is a general overview of the Linux boot process, and the exact steps may vary depending on the specific distribution and configuration. However, this sequence of events provides a good understanding of how the Linux operating system starts up and becomes 
    usable. <br><br><br>
