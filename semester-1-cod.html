  <button class="faq__question">What is Number Systems and its types?</button> <!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
    The number system is simply a system to represent or express numbers. There are various types of number systems and the most commonly used ones are decimal number system, binary number system, octal number system, and hexadecimal number system.    <!--Answer--> 
    <br>
    1. Binary Number System : The binary number has a radix of 2. As r = 2, only two digits are needed, and these are 0 and 1. In binary system weight is expressed as power of 2. <br>
    Eg : (1101.011)2
    <br>
    2. Decimal Number System : The decimal system has ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. In other words, it has a base of 10. <br>
    Eg : (52.79)10
    <br>
    3. Octal Number System : Digital systems operate only on binary numbers. Since binary numbers are often very long, two shorthand notations, octal and hexadecimal, are used for representing large binary numbers. Octal systems use a base or radix of 8. It uses first eight digits of decimal number system. Thus it has digits from 0 to 7. <br>
    Eg : (52.17)8
    <br>
    4. Hexa Decimal Number System : The hexadecimal numbering system has a base of 16. There are 16 symbols. The decimal digits 0 to 9 are used as the first ten digits as in the decimal system, followed by the letters A, B, C, D, E and F, which represent the values 10, 11,12,13,14 and 15 respectively. <br>
    Eg : (A2.D4)16

  <button class="faq__question">What is Sum of Product(SOP)?</button> <!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. POS stands for Product of Sums. A technique of explaining a Boolean expression through a set of max terms or sum terms, is known as POS(product of sum). <br>
  2. Every term of standard POS (SPOS) form is called a maxterm. <br>
  3. In the case of POS, the Maxterms are defined as 'M'<br>
  4. It gives LOW(0) output. <br>
  5. In POS, we can get the final term by multiplying the sum terms. <br>
  6. Product of Sum Expression : 
		Q = (A+B+C) . (A+C) . (B+C)                            <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Product of Sum(POS)?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. SOP stands for Sum of Product. SOP form is a set of product(AND) terms that are summed(OR) together. When an expression or term is represented in a sum of binary terms known as min. <br>
  2. The Sum of Product expression is equivalent to the logical AND function which Sums two or more Products to produce an output. <br>
  3. Every term of standard SOP (SSOP) representation of Boolean expression is called a minterm. <br>
  4. In the case of SOP, the minterms are defined as 'm'. <br>
  5. It gives HIGH(1) output. <br>
  6. In SOP, we can get the final term by adding the product terms. <br>
  7.  Sum of Product Expression : 
          Q = (A.B.C) + (A.C) + (B.C)
                                        <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is a K-Map?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. The K-map is a systematic way of simplifying Boolean expressions. With the help of the K-map method, we can find the simplest POS and SOP expression, which is known as the minimum expression. <br>
  2. Just like the truth table, a K-map contains all the possible values of input variables and their corresponding output values. However, in K-map, the values are stored in cells of the array. In each cell, a binary value of each input variable is stored. <br>
  3. The K-map method is used for expressions containing 2, 3 and 4 variables. For example, if the number of variables is three, the number of cells is 23=8, and if the number of variables is four, the number of cells is 24. The K-map takes the SOP and POS forms. The K-map grid is filled using 0's and 1's. The K-map is solved by making groups. <br>

  <button class="faq__question">What is Addressing Mode</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. Addressing modes are the manner in the data is accessed.
    Depending upon the type of instruction applied, addressing modes are of various types such as direct mode <br><br>
  2. where straight data is accessed or indirect mode where the location of the data is accessed. 
    The operation field of an instruction specifies the operation to be performed. This operation will be executed on some data which is stored in computer registers or the main memory. The way any operand is selected during the program execution is dependent on the addressing mode of the instruction. <br><br>
  3. The addressing modes in computer architecture actually define how an operand is chosen to execute an instruction.  It is the way that is used to identify the location of an operand which is specified in an instruction. Whenever an instruction executes, it requires operands to be operated on.  <br><br>
  4. An instruction field consisting of opcode and operand. Where operand means the data and opcode means the instruction itself. In case of operations like addition or subtraction, they require two data. So, 
  they are called binary instruction. On the other hand, the increment or decrement operations need only one data and are so called unary instruction.  The various addressing modes in computer architecture can be classified as below.   We have some other addressing modes too, but these are the prime addressing modes in computer architecture.

  <button class="faq__question">What is Fan-in Requirement?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. Fan-in is a term that defines the maximum number of digital inputs that a single logic gate can accept. <br>
  1. Most transistor-transistor logic ( TTL ) gates have one or two inputs, although some have more than two. A typical logic gate has a fan-in of 1 or 2. <br>
  3. In some digital systems, it is necessary for a single TTL logic gate to drive several devices with fan-in numbers greater than 1. <br>
  4. If the total number of inputs a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) device must drive is greater than 10, a device called a buffer can be used between the TTL gate output and the inputs of the devices it must drive.  <br>
  5. A logical inverter (also called a NOT gate) can serve this function in most digital circuits. <br>

  <button class="faq__question">What is Fan-out Requirement?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. Fan-out is a term that defines the maximum number of digital inputs that the output of a single logic gate can feed.   <br>
  2. Most transistor-transistor logic ( TTL ) gates can feed up to 10 other digital gates or devices. Thus, a typical TTL gate has a fan-out of 10. <br>
  3. In some digital systems, it is necessary for a single TTL logic gate to drive more than 10 other gates or devices. <br>
  4. When this is the case, a device called a buffer can be used between the TTL gate and the multiple devices it must drive. <br>
  5. A buffer of this type has a fan-out of 25 to 30. A logical inverter (also called a NOT gate) can serve this function in most digital circuits. <br> <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Half-Adder and Full Adder?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  <b>Half Adder :-</b> <br>
  1. So, coming to the scenario of half adder, it adds two binary digits where the input bits are termed as augend and addend and the result will be two outputs one is the sum and the other is carry. To perform the sum operation, XOR is applied to both the inputs, and AND gate is applied to both inputs to produce carry. <br>
  2. By using a half adder, you can design simple addition with the help of logic gates <!--Answer-->
  <br><br>
  <b>Full Adder :-</b> <br>
  1. This adder is difficult to implement when compared to half-adder.
  The difference between a half-adder and a full-adder is that the full-adder has three inputs and two outputs, whereas half adder has only two inputs and two outputs. <br>
  2. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. When a full-adder logic is designed, you string eight of them together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to the next. <br>

  <button class="faq__question">What is Half Subtractor and Full Subtractor</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
    <b>Half Subtractor :-</b> <br>
    The half subtractor is also a building block for subtracting two binary numbers. It has two inputs and two outputs. This circuit is used to subtract two single bit binary numbers A and B. The 'diff' and 'borrow' are two output states of the half subtractor. <br><br>
    <b>Full Subtractor:-</b> <br>
    The Half Subtractor is used to subtract only two numbers. To overcome this problem, a full subtractor was designed. The full subtractor is used to subtract three 1-bit numbers A, B, and C, which are minuend, subtrahend, and borrow, respectively. The full subtractor has three input states and two output states i.e., diff and borrow.                       <!--Answer-->

  <p class="faq__answer">
   <b>Multiplexer :-</b><br>
  1. A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that has 2n input lines and a single output line. Simply, the multiplexer is a multi-input and single-output combinational circuit. The binary information is received from the input lines and directed to the output line. On the basis of the values of the selection lines, one of these data inputs will be connected to the output. <br>
  2. A multiplexer is also treated as Mux. <br><br><!--Answer-->
  <b>De-Multiplexer :-</b><br>
  1. A De-multiplexer is a combinational circuit that has only 1 input line and 2N output lines. Simply, the multiplexer is a single-input and multi-output combinational circuit. The information is received from the single input lines and directed to the output line. On the basis of the values of the selection lines, the input will be connected to one of these outputs. De-multiplexer is opposite to the multiplexer. <br>
  2. De-multiplexer is also treated as De-mux.

  <button class="faq__question">What is a Flip Flop and what is the types of Flip Flops?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
    Latches are basic storage elements that operate with signal levels (rather than signal transitions). Latches controlled by a clock transition are flip-flops. <br>
    <b>S-R Flip Flop :-</b><br>
    A circuit that has two stable states is treated as a flip flop. These stable states are used to store binary data that can be changed by applying varying inputs. 
  2. Flip flops and latches are examples of data storage elements. In the sequential logical circuit,   the  flip flop is the basic storage element. The latches and flip flops are the basic storage elements but different in working. <br><br>
  <b>J-K Flip Flop :-</b> <br>
  1. The SR Flip Flop or Set-Reset flip flop has lots of advantages. But, it has the following switching problems. <br>
  2. When Set 'S' and Reset 'R' inputs are set to 0, this condition is always avoided.
    When the Set or Reset input changes their state while the enable input is 1, the incorrect latching action occurs. <br>
  3. The JK Flip Flop removes these two drawbacks of SR Flip Flop.<!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Shift Registers and its types?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
  1. A shift register is a type of digital circuit using a cascade of flip-flops where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next. They share a single clock signal, which causes the data stored in the system to shift from one location to the next. <br>
  2. One flip-flop can store one-bit of information. In order to store multiple bits of information, we require multiple flip-flops. The group of flip-flops, which are used to hold store the binary data is known as register. <br>
  3. If the register is capable of shifting bits either towards right hand side or towards left hand side is known as shift register. An 'N' bit shift register contains 'N' flip-flops. Following are the four types of shift registers based on applying inputs and accessing of outputs. <br>
  Serial In - Serial Out (SISO) shift register <br>

  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
    <b>COMPLEX INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTING(CISC) :-</b><br>  
    Hardware designers invent numerous technologies & tools to implement the desired architecture in order to fulfill these needs. Hardware architecture may be implemented to be either hardware specific or software specific, but according to the application both are used in the required quantity.  As far as the processor hardware is concerned, there are 2 types of concepts to implement the processor hardware architecture.  First one is RISC and other is CISC.
    <br><br>
    <b>REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTING(RISC) :-</b><br>
    RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is used in portable devices due to its power efficiency.   For Example, Apple iPod and Nintendo DS. RISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses highly-optimized set of instructions.  RISC does the opposite, reducing the cycles per instruction at the cost of the number of instructions per program Pipelining is one of the unique feature of RISC.  It is performed by overlapping the execution of several instructions in a pipeline fashion. It has a high performance advantage over CISC.                              <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Instruction Cycle and its types?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
    The execution instructions define the instruction cycle. This is the thorough methodology computer processors use for executing a given instruction. Many times processors can be compared to combustion engines. Both follow a process continuously being carried out to fetch the desired outcome. Every processor shows a three-step instruction cycle. These three steps of the instruction execution cycle are, <br>
  1. Fetch:  
  The processor copies the instruction data captured from the RAM. <br>
  2. Decode: 
  Decoded captured data is transferred to the unit for execution. <br>
  3. Execute: 
  Instruction is finally executed. The result is then registered in the processor or RAM (memory address). <br>

  <button class="faq__question">What is the Five Stage of Organization?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
  <p class="faq__answer">
   <b> Instruction Fetch Section :-</b> <br> 
    1. The addresses used to access the memory come from the PC when fetching instructions and from register RZ in the datapath (indirect and index mode) when accessing instruction operands. <br>
    2. Multiplexer MuxMA selects one of these two sources to be sent to the processormemory interface. The PC is included in a larger block, the instruction address generator, which updates the contents of the PC after each instruction is fetched.  
    <br><br>
    <b>Source Registers :-</b><br>
    For a Store instruction, data are read from the register file, which is part of stage 2, and placed in register RB. Since memory access is done in stage 4, another inter-stage register is needed to maintain correct data flow in the multi-stage structure. Register RM is introduced for this purpose. The data to be stored are moved from RB to RM in step 3, and from there to the memory in step 4. No action is taken in step 5 in this case. <br><br>
    <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) :-</b><br>
    The arithmetic and logic unit is used to manipulate data. 
    It performs arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, 
    and logic operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.  Conceptually, the register file 
    and the ALU may be connected. <br><br>
    <b>Memory Access :-</b><br>
    For Load and Store instructions, the effective address of the memory operand is computed by the ALU in step 3 and loaded into register RZ. From there, it is sent to the memory, which is stage 4.  
    <br><br>
     <b>Destination Register :-</b><br>
     The contents of RY are transferred to the register file in step 5 and loaded into the destination register. For this reason, the register file is in both stages 2 and 5. It is a part of stage 2 because it contains the source registers and a part of stage 5 because it contains the destination register. <br>
