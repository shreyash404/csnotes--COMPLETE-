  <br>
  <p>A database management system (DBMS) is a software that enables the creation, organization, and management of databases. It is an essential tool for storing, organizing, and manipulating large amounts of data in a structured and efficient way.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>MySQL is a popular open-source DBMS that is widely used in computer science. It is a fast, reliable, and scalable DBMS that supports a wide range of data types and can handle large amounts of data.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>One of the main benefits of using MySQL is that it allows users to easily create and manipulate databases using Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is a programming language specifically designed for interacting with databases, and it is widely used in computer science for tasks such as querying, updating, and deleting data from a database.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>In addition to its powerful SQL capabilities, MySQL also offers a range of features that make it easy to use and manage. It has a user-friendly interface, support for multiple users and security features, and a range of tools and utilities for backing up, restoring, and optimizing databases.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Overall, MySQL is an essential tool for computer scientists and professionals working with large amounts of data. Its powerful features and ease of use make it an excellent choice for a variety of applications, from web development to data analysis and more.</p>

  <button class="faq__question">What is the Database and its Advantages?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
   1. Data can be defined as facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example,
      the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of people. <br>
  2.  <b>A Database</b> is a collection of related data. It is a logically related collection of data with some
      inherent meaning. A database is designed for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of
      users and applications. <br>
  3.  A DataBase Management System (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to
      create and maintain a database. <br>
      Examples of DBMS - MySQL, Microsoft Access, Oracle, MongoDB etc.
  4.  The database and DBMS software together is called a <b>Database system.</b><br><br>
  <b>Advantages of DBMS -</b><br><br>    
  <b>Controlling Redundancy :-</b>
  In traditional file processing, every user group maintains its own files.
  This redundancy in storing the same data multiple times leads to several problems. In DBMS, all
  data is integrated into a single database file. <br>
  <b>Data Security :-</b> 
  DBMS can enforce access controls to different classes of users. This provides
  security for protecting database against accidental or intentional loss, destruction or misuse. 
  <br>
  <b>Data sharing :-</b>
   DBMS can allow multiple users to access the database at the same time. Remote
  users also can share the same data. Same database can be shared between different
  applications.  <br>
  <b>Data Integrity :-</b>
  Integrity stands for consistency and correctness. DBMS can enforce integrity
  constraints which provide a way of ensuring that changes made to the database by authorized
  users do not result in a loss of data. <br>
  <b>Data Independence :-</b>
   DBMS provides an abstract view of data that hides details of data
  representation and storage from end users. Data independence also means the capacity to
  change data kept at one place without changing data kept at other locations. 
  <br>
  <b>Providing Backup and Recovery :-</b>
   A DBMS can provide facilities for recovering from hardware or
   software failures.         <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">Define Derived attribute,  Domain,  Strong entity,  Superkey,  Tupel.</button> <!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      <b>Derived Attribute:</b> A derived attribute is an attribute of a table in a database that can be calculated from other attributes. It does not require to be stored in the table and can be computed on the fly when required. For example, a customer table might have a "Total_spent" attribute that is calculated from the sum of all orders made by that customer. <br> <br>

      <b>Domain:</b> The domain of an attribute in a database is the set of allowed values for that attribute. It defines the data type and range of values that can be stored in that attribute. For example, if an attribute "Age" has a domain of INTEGER, it means that only integer values are allowed in that attribute.<br> <br>
      
      <b>Strong Entity:</b> A strong entity is an entity in a database that has a primary key and can exist independently of other entities. A strong entity has its own unique identifier and can be identified and distinguished from other entities based on its primary key.<br> <br>
      
      <b>Superkey:</b> A superkey is a set of attributes in a table that can be used to uniquely identify a record in the table. A superkey can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes. A primary key is a superkey that has been chosen by the database designer to be the unique identifier for the table.<br> <br>
      
      <b>Tuple:</b> A tuple is a single row of data in a relational database table. It is a collection of values that represent a single record in the table. Each value in the tuple corresponds to an attribute of the table. For example, if a table has the attributes "ID", "Name", and "Address", a tuple might contain the values "1", "John Smith", and "123 Main St".<br> <br>

  <button class="faq__question">What is a Data Model and its types?</button> <!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
   Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data models define how data is
  connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system. <br><br>
  1.The <b>Main data model</b> used in many current commercial DBMSs is the relational data model. It
  represents a database as a collection of tables, where each table can be stored as a separate
  file. Most relational databases use the high-level query language called SQL.
  Examples - MySQL, Oracle <br><br>
  2. The <b>Object data model</b> has been implemented in some commercial systems but has not had
  widespread use. The object data model defines a database in terms of objects, their properties,
  and their operations. <br><br>
  Two other important data models, now are the <b>Network and Hierarchical models.</b> <br>
  4. The <b>Network model</b> represents data as record types and represents a limited type of 1:N
  relationship. A 1:N, or one-to-many, relationship relates one instance of a record to many record
  instances using some pointer linking mechanism in these models.
  Examples - IDMS and SUPRA  <br><br>                          <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Specialization and Generalization?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      <b>Specialization</b> is the process of defining a set of subclasses of an entity type which is called the
  superclass of the specialization.
  For example, the set of subclasses {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN} is a specialization of the
  superclass EMPLOYEE that distinguishes among employee entities based on the job type of each
  employee entity. Another specialization of the EMPLOYEE entity type may yield the set of subclasses
  {SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE}; this specialization distinguishes among employees based
  on the method of pay. <br><br>
  <b>Generalization</b><br>
  The reverse process of abstraction in which we suppress the differences among several entity types,
  identify their common features, and generalize them into a single superclass of which the original entity
  types are special subclasses is called Generalization.
  For example, consider the entity types CAR and TRUCK . Because they have several common attributes,
  they can be generalized into the entity type VEHICLE.                                     <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">What is Loseless Join Decomposition?</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
  • Decomposition of a relation is done when a relation in relational model is not in
  appropriate normal form. <br><br>
  • Relation R is decomposed into two or more relations if decomposition is lossless join as
  well as dependency preserving. <br><br>
  • A decomposition of a relation R into relations R1 and R2 is lossless if,
  1. Union of Attributes of R1 and R2 must be equal to attribute of R. Each attribute of R
  must be either in R1 or in R2. <br><br>
  Attributes(R1) U Attributes(R2) = Attributes(R)
  2. Intersection of Attributes of R1 and R2 must not be NULL.
  Attributes(R1) ∩ AMributes(R2) ≠ Φ <br><br>
  3. Common attribute must be a primary key for at least one relation R1 or R2.
  Attributes(R1) ∩ AMributes(R2) → AMributes(R1)
  OR 
  Attributes(R1) ∩ AMributes(R2) → AMributes(R2)
  • If we decompose a relation R into relations R1 and R2, All dependencies of R either must
  be a part of R1 or R2 or must be derivable from combination of FD's of R1 and R2.

  <button class="faq__question">What are the Constraints and its types?</button>
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
      • MySQL CONSTRAINT is used to define rules to allow or restrict what values can be stored in
  columns. The purpose of inducing constraints is to enforce the integrity of a database.
  • MySQL CONSTRAINTS are used to limit the type of data that can be inserted into a table. <br><br>
  1. Domain constraints
  o Domain constraints can be defined as the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute.
  NOT NULL - allows to specify that a column can not contain any NULL value.
  DEFAULT - In a MySQL table, each column must contain a value ( including a NULL). While inserting data
  into a table, if no value is supplied to a column, then the column gets the value set as DEFAULT. <br><br>
  2. Entity integrity constraints
  PRIMARY KEY - A PRIMARY KEY constraint for a table enforces the table to accept unique data for a
  specific column and this constraint creates a unique index for accessing the table faster.
  UNIQUE - The UNIQUE constraint in MySQL does not allow to insert a duplicate value in a column. <br><br>
  3. Referential Integrity Constraints
  o A referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables.
  o In the Referential integrity constraints, if a foreign key in Table 1 refers to the Primary Key of
  Table 2, then every value of the Foreign Key in Table 1 must be null or be available in Table 2.
  FOREIGN KEY - A FOREIGN KEY in MySQL creates a link between two tables by one specific column of
  both tables

  <button class="faq__question">What is Backup and Restore in DBMS?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
  One important task of a database administrator is to regularly backup the database. Then if the
  database ever becomes corrupted, the database administrator can use the backup files to restore the
  database. <br><br>
  It is important to make regular backups of all data in case of loss. Database recovery is the process of
  restoring the database to original state as it was before database failure occurs.
  mysqldump is an effective tool to backup MySQL database. It creates a *.sql file.
  <b># mysqldump -u root -p[root_password] [database_name] > dumpfilename.sql</b><br><br>
  When you are restoring the dumpfilename.sql on a remote database, make sure to create the database
  before you can perform the restore.
  <b># <code> mysql -u root -p[root_password] [database_name] < dumpfilename.sql</code></b>
      </p>

    <button class="faq__question">What is a SubQuery and its types?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
  In MySQL, a subquery is a query within a query. You can create subqueries within your SQL statements.
  A sub query is a select query that is contained inside another query. The inner select query is usually
  used to determine the results of the outer select query. <br><br>
  Types of Subqueries <br><br>
  1) A scalar subquery is a subquery that returns exactly one column value from one row. <br><br>
  2) An independent subquery is the subquery that return at most one value. SQL then compares the
  value that results from the subquery with the value on the other side of the comparison
  operator. <br><br>
  SELECT employee_id,name,salary
  FROM employees WHERE salary >
  (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM employees);
  3) Multiple row subquery is the one that returns more than one row <br><br>
  4) A correlated subquery is a subquery that contains a reference to a table (in the parent query) that
  also appears in the inner query. A correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row in outer
  query

    <button class="faq__question">What are the Types of Threats to Database Security?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
  1. <b>Privilege abuse:</b> When database users are provided with privileges that exceeds their day-to-day job
  requirement, these privileges may be misused intentionally or unintentionally. <br><br>
  2.<b> Operating System vulnerabilities:</b> Vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems like Windows, UNIX,
  Linux, etc., and the services that are related to the databases could lead to unauthorized access. <br><br>
  3.<b>Weak authentication:</b> Weak authentication models allow attackers to employ strategies such as to
  obtain database login credentials and assume the identity of legitimate database users. <br><br>
  4. <b>Input Injection (SQL Injection)</b>
  This type of attack allows an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a
  computer in order to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on
  a web site.<br><br>
  5. <b>Unavailability of data</b> : authorized users must be able to access data at any time

    <button class="faq__question">What are the Security Mechanisms?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        • A DBMS system always has a separate system for security which is responsible for protecting
database against accidental or intentional loss, destruction or misuse. <br>
• Security Mechanisms:
 Access Control(Authorization) -Each application is associated with a specified role. Each
role has a list of authorized users who may execute/Design/administers the application <br><br>
• Authenticate the User:This may be done with help of concept of views in Relational
databases. <br><br>
• Cryptographic control/Data Encryption -Encode data in a cryptic form(Coded)so that
although data is captured by unintentional user still he can't be able to decode the data. <br><br>
•  Inference control - Prevent disclosure of data through statistical summaries of
confidential data. <br><br>
• Physical Protection: Computer systems must be physically secured against any
unauthorized entry <br><br>
• Virus control: There should be mechanism for providing protection against data virus. <br><br>
• Granting of privileges: <br><br>
 A system privilege is the right to perform a particular action, or to perform an action on
any schema objects of a particular type. <br><br>
 An authorized user may pass on this authorization to other users. This process is called
as granting of privileges. <br><br>

  <button class="faq__question">What are the Roles of Database Administrator(DBA)?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        A Database Administrator is a person or a group of person who are responsible for managing all the
activities related to database system. This job requires a high level of expertise.
Responsibilities of database Administrator( DBA) <br><br>
1. Deciding the hardware device
Depending upon the cost, performance and efficiency of the hardware, it is DBA who have the duty of
deciding which hardware devise will suit the company requirement. <br><br>
2. Installing and Configuration of database: DBA is responsible for installing the database software. He
configure the software of database and then upgrades it if needed. <br><br>
3. Managing Data Integrity
Data integrity should be managed accurately because it protects the data from unauthorized use. DBA
manages relationship between the data to maintain data consistency. <br><br>
4. Decides Data Recovery and Back up method
If any company is having a big database, then it is likely to happen that database may fail at any
instance. It is require that a DBA takes backup of entire database in regular time span. DBA has to decide
that how much data should be backed up and how frequently the back should be taken. <br><br>
5. Tuning Database Performance 
Database performance plays an important role for any business. If user is not able to fetch data speedily
then it may loss company business. <br><br>
6. Database design
The logical design of the database is designed by the DBA. Also a DBA is responsible for physical design,
external model design, and integrity control. <br><br>
8. Decides validation checks on data <br><br>
9. Monitoring performance <br><br>
10. Provides help and support to user <br>

    <button class="faq__question">What are the Views?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
      1. In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
By virtual, we mean, the tables do not store any data of their own but display data stored in other tables
referenced in the SELECT statement.
Views improve security of the database by showing only intended data to authorized users. They hide
sensitive data. <br><br>
2. Views make life easy as you do not have write complex queries time and again.
It's possible to use INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on a VIEW. These operations will change the underlying
tables of the VIEW. <br><br>
3. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more
real tables in the database. <br><br>
4. CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW command.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW command.
DROP VIEW view_name;

  <button class="faq__question">What are the different types of database users?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
     <b> Database Administrators (DBAs) -</b> These users have full control over the database and are responsible for managing and maintaining the database, including creating and modifying tables, managing user accounts, and performing backups and restores.
      <br><br>
    <b> Application Users -</b>  These users are responsible for interacting with the database through an application, such as a website or software program. They typically have limited access to the database, with permissions to perform specific tasks such as querying, inserting, and updating data.
    <br><br>
     <b>End/Naive Users -</b>  These users are the final users who access the database through an application or website. They typically have the least amount of access to the database and are only able to view or retrieve data.                                 <!--Answer-->

  <button class="faq__question">Explain Inner join and Outer join?</button><!--Question-->
  <div class="faq__panel">
    <p class="faq__answer">
     <b> Inner Join: </b> An inner join in MySQL is used to retrieve only the matching records from two or more tables. The result of an inner join will include only the rows from both tables where the join condition is met. The syntax for an inner join in MySQL is as follows:
        <br><br>
      <code> SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;</code>
      <br><br>
      For example, imagine we have two tables: "customers" and "orders". The customers table has a column named "customer_id", and the orders table has a column named "customer_id" as well. We want to retrieve all the orders made by a specific customer.
      <br><br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id WHERE customers.customer_id = 1;</code> 
      <br><hr><br>
      <b>Outer Join:</b> An outer join in MySQL is used to retrieve all records from one table and the matching records from another table. If there is no matching record in the second table, the result will include a NULL value in the columns of the second table. The syntax for an outer join in MySQL is as follows:
      <br><br>
     <code> SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;</code>
      <br><br>
      For example, imagine we have two tables: "employees" and "departments". The employees table has a column named "department_id", and the departments table has a column named "department_id" as well. We want to retrieve all the employees and their departments.
      <br><br>
     <code> SELECT * FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;</code>
      <br><br>
      This query will retrieve all the employees, even if they are not assigned to a department, in this case the department_id column will be null on the department side.                                  <!--Answer-->
