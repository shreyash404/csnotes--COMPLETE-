  <br>
  <p>Free and open source software (FOSS) is a critical subject in the field of computer science. FOSS refers to software that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.</p>
  <br>
  <p>One of the main benefits of FOSS is that it allows users to have control over the software they use. This is important because it allows users to customize the software to meet their specific needs and to fix any issues they may encounter.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Another benefit of FOSS is that it promotes collaboration and innovation. By making the source code of a software program available to the public, developers can work together to improve the software and add new features. This can lead to faster development and a more robust product.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In addition to these benefits, FOSS also has social and ethical implications. By using FOSS, users can support the development of software that is available to everyone, rather than just those who can afford to purchase proprietary software. This helps to promote accessibility and digital inclusion for all.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Overall, FOSS is an important concept in computer science and has many practical and ethical benefits. It is worth learning about and considering using FOSS software in your own projects.</p>

    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        <b>Free Software</b><br>
        1. Free software usually refers open
        source under GNU GPL
        license. Because the word free in
        English means without cost the
        terms open source was created. <br><br>
        2. Software is an important part of
        people's lives. <br><br>
        3.Software freedom translates to social freedom. <br><br>
        4. Freedom is a value that is more
        important than any economical
        advantage. <br><br>
        5. Examples: The Free Software
        Directory maintains a large
        database of free-software
        
        packages. Some of the best-
        known examples include the
        
        Linux kernel, the BSD and Linux
        operating systems, the GNU
        Compiler Collection and C
        library; the MySQL relational
        database; the Apache web server;
        and the Sendmail mail transport
        agent.
        <br><br>
        <b>Open Source Software</b><br>
        1. Your source code is accessible to
        anyone to read and modify and
        redistribute depending on license
        conditions. Publishing source code
        online without the public being able to
        modify them doesn't make lots of
        sense. <br><br>  
        2. Software is just software. There are no
        ethics associated directly to it. <br><br>
        3. Ethics are to be associated to the people not to the software. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Closed Source Software</b> <br>
        Closed source software refers to the computer software which source code
        is closes means public is not given access to the source code. In short it is referred
        as CSS. In closed source software the source code is protected. Only the original
        authors of software can access, copy, and alter that software. In a case with closed
        source software, you are not purchasing the software, but only pay to use it. The
        price of closed source software is high and users need to have valid and
        authenticated license to use the software. As is issues an authenticated license so
        it also put a lot restriction on users based on usability and modification of
        software. <br><br>
        Some examples of closed source software are Skype, Google earth, Java,
        Adobe Flash, Virtual Box, Adobe Reader, Microsoft office, Microsoft Windows,
        WinRAR, mac OS, Adobe Flash Player etc.                                    <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is License? and Some Examples of Licenses.</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        What is a Licence? <br>
        The simplest explanation is that open source licenses are legal and binding
        contracts between the author and the user of a software component, declaring that
        the software can be used in commercial applications under specified conditions.
        The license is what turns code into an open source component. Without an open
        source license, the software component is unusable by others, even if it has been
        publicly posted on GitHub. <br><br>
        Each open source license states what users are permitted do with the
        software components, their obligations, and what they cannot do as per the terms
        and conditions. This might sound pretty straight forward, but there are over 200
        open source licenses out there so good luck keeping them all organized. Varying in
        complexity and requirements, it is up to organizations to choose which licenses are
        most compatible with their policies to ensure that they remain compliant. <br><br>
        These licenses are intended to permit, and indeed, to encourage the
        contributions of others to the project. Nonetheless, one of the first open
        development projects relied, at least at the beginning, on a relatively small number
        of closely-knit developers. This project was Richard Stallman's plan to develop a
        complete operating system modeled after the Unix operating system but written
        entirely in free code. <br><br>
        The main problem in this context is that open source licenses are subjective.
        Their interpretation depends on the technical usage of the licensed software.
        Therefore, it's difficult to determine the legal risks of using open source software,
        especially for developers, who are not usually legal experts. What developers need
        is a broad classification of licenses based on the risks they pose in terms of legal
        compliance.
        <br><br>
        <b>I. GNU General Public License (GPL)</b> <br>

GNU General Public License isthe most popular open source license
around. Richard Stallman created the GPL to protect the GNU software from
becoming proprietary, and it is a specific implementation of his "copyleft" concept. <br><br>

GPL is a copyleft license. This means that any software that is written based
on any GPL component must be released as open source. The result is that any
software that uses any GPL open source component (regardless of its percentage in
the entire code) is required to release its full source code and all of the rights to
modify and distribute the entire code.
There has always been some confusion regarding what constitutes a 'work
based on' another work, which in turn triggers the GPL reciprocity obligation. The
FSF tried to add more clarity to GPLv3 as to when the reciprocity obligation is
triggered. The FSF even wrote a new GPL license, the Affero license, to address a
specific confusion referred to as the “ASP loophole”.
In addition, the FSF tried to increase the compatibility of the GPLv3 with
other licenses. To combine two codes into a larger work, both the programs must
permit it. If such rights are granted by both the programs' licenses, they are
compatible. By making the GPLv3 more compatible, the FSF expanded
development options. <br><br>
<b>II. The Apache License</b> <br><br>

The Apache License is an open source software license
released by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It's a popular and widely
deployed license backed by a strong community. The Apache License allows you
to freely use, modify, and distribute any Apache licensed product. However, while
doing so, you're required to follow the terms of the Apache License.
The Apache Group (later named the Apache Software Foundation) released
the first version of its license in 1995, but it's rare that you'll come across
components that still carry this license.
In 2000, when Berkeley accepted the argument put to it by the Free Software
Foundation and retired their advertising clause from the BSD license and formed
the modified BSD license, Apache did likewise and created the Apache License
version 1.1.
Removing the advertising clause meant that the advertising materials of the
derivative works of any Apache licensed product were no longer required to include
the Apache License attribution. It became ok to include the attribution in the
documentation alone.
In 2004, the ASF decided to depart from the BSD model a little more radically
and produced the Apache License version 2.0 by granting patents rights and
defining solid definitions of the concepts it uses to make <br><br>
<b>III. Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</b> <br><br>

BSD Licenses or the original BSD License and its two variants - the
Modified BSD License (3-clause), and the Simplified BSD License/FreeBSD
License (2-clause) are a family of permissive free software licenses.

The BSD License lets you freely modify and distribute your software's code
in the source or binary format as long as you retain a copy of the copyright notice,
list of conditions, and the disclaimer.
The original BSD License or the 4-clause BSD License also contains an advertising
clause and a non-endorsement clause (detailed explanation about these clauses are
offered in the following questions). The modified BSD License or the 3-clause BSD
License was formed by removing the advertising clause from the original BSD
License. Further, the FreeBSD version or the 2-clause BSD License was formed by
removing the non-endorsement clause from the modified BSD License or the 3-
clause BSD License. <br><br>
<b>IV. Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)</b> <br><br>

CDDL is an open source license published by Sun
Microsystems to replace the Sun Public License (SPL). The CDDL license is
considered by Sun (now Oracle) to be SPL version 2. It is inspired by the Mozilla
Public License (MPL). Sun used to release its free software / open source projects
under its Sun Public License (SPL) before it turned to rely upon the CDDL in 2004.
CDDL is often dubbed as a cleaned up version of the MPL and is made to facilitate
reusability.
You're free to reproduce and distribute any original or derivative works of
any software licensed under the CDDL. However, you must not remove or make
any changes to any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained in the software.
You must also retain any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any contributor or the initial developer.
When you distribute your software in an executable form (any form other
than source code), you are required to make the source code available as well under
the CDDL. The executable form may be released under the CDDL or any CDDL
compatible licenses.
The source code that you have to make available includes your contributions
as long as they are an addition to, deletion from or modification of the contents of
a file containing the original software - or new files that contain parts of the original
program. That means that if your additions are made in separate and independent
files that do not contain the original code, you do not have to release it under the
CDDL. You may do that if you choose to, but you're not obliged.
In addition, you must include a copy of the CDDL with any source code that
you distribute. For each modification that you make, you must identify yourself as
the modifier by including a notice in your modified files. <br><br>
<b>V. Eclipse Public License (EPL)</b> <br><br>

The Eclipse Public License (EPL) is an open source license
developed by the Eclipse Foundation. It's derived from the Common Public License
(CPL). The Eclipse codebase now available under the EPL was formerly licensed
under the CPL.

The EPL license is a copyleft license. If you modify an EPL'ed component
and distribute it in the source code form as part of your program, you're required to
disclose the modified code under the EPL. If you distribute such a program in its
object code form, you're required to state that the source code can be made available
to the recipient upon request. You're also required to share the method for
requesting the source code.
The Eclipse Foundation makes clear that, in their opinion, 'merely
interfacing or interoperating' with an Eclipse plugin does not make your code a
derivative work of the plugin.
If you redistribute a program with an EPL component, you are obligated
to include the full license text and the copyrights.
The EPL protects the author from possible lawsuits or damages caused if a
company used his/her component in a commercial product. It also offers a patent
grant. <br><br>
<b>VI. MIT License</b> <br><br>
 
MIT is one of the most permissive free software licenses. Basically,
you can do whatever you want with software licensed under the MIT license - only
if you add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it. Its simplicity
is the reason behind its high adoption rate among developers.

    <button class="faq__question">What are the Principles of Open Source Software?</button> <!--Question-->
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        • Principles of the open source <br>
        1. Transparency: Whether we're developing software or solving a business problem,
        we all have access to the information and materials necessary for doing our best
        work. And when these materials are accessible, we can build upon each other's ideas
        and discoveries. We can make more effective decisions and understand how
        decisions affect us. <br><br>
       2. Collaboration: When we're free to participate, we can enhance each other's work
        in unanticipated ways. When we can modify what others have shared, we unlock
        new possibilities. By initiating new projects together, we can solve problems that
        no one can solve alone. And when we implement open standards, we enable others
        to contribute in the future. <br><br>
        3. Release early and often: Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid discoveries. An
        iterative approach leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment,
        you can look at problems in new ways and seek answers in new places. You can
        learn by doing. <br><br>
       4. Inclusive meritocracy: Good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas
        should win. Only by including diverse perspectives in our conversations can we be
        certain we've identified the best ideas, and decision-makers continually seek those
        perspectives. We may not operate by consensus, but successful work determines
        which projects gather support and effort from the community. <br><br>
       5. Community: Communities form when different people unite around a common
        purpose. Shared values guide decision making, and community goals supersede
        individual interests and agendas.                                      <!--Answer-->

      <p class="faq__answer">
        <b>Copyright ©</b><br><br>
        Copyright is a bundle of rights granted to a creator providing him with
        exclusive rights over his original artistic and literary creation. It is not
        necessary that a copyright be registered, it is attached automatically to any
        original artistic work. When the idea of a creator is converted to a material
        form, the same immediately gets protected under the copyright. For a work to
        be copyrighted, it is necessary that the work is original work of literature,
        drama, music, or any other art having artistic value. While copyright protects
        the material form of an idea it does not protect the idea in itself. It is essential
        and of significant importance, that permission is sought and the same is granted
        by the copyright owner before it is republished or reproduced. <br><br>
        The bundle of rights granted to the copyright owner includes the rights
        to reproduce, copy, publish, communicate, and translate the copyrighted work.
        Such a right is a natural right granted to the owner of the artistic work
        immediately on the making of the same.
        <br><br>
        <b>Copyleft</b><br><br>
        Most of the creative works, including software programs and codes,
        comes within the domain of copyright protection and therefore can be
        copyrighted. However, it is to be noted that software and programming is an
        area where already existing programs many-a-times are used as a base to build
        new software or program. It is for this reason, many software owners tend to
        grant a license to its users a license allowing them to modify and alter their
        work. Such permission and license can be referred to as Copyleft. <br><br>
        Copyleft can be said to be a specific kind of a license that allows free
        use of copyrighted material but under certain terms and conditions, granted by
        the owner of the copyright himself. For instance, software having a copylefted
        license can be modified, used, distributed, or reproduced provided the source
        code kept open and available to the public. <br><br>
        A copylefted software must be
        transferred with a similar copyleft license to all its successive users and the
        license also shall mandate any modification to the software shall be copylefted
        in a similar manner. In simpler words, copyleft is a license that provides
        original work to a third person giving him certain rights like that of copying
        and modifying and any new work carved out based on such original work shall
        have a copyleft license in a similar manner.                                     <!--Answer-->

    <button class="faq__question">What is Shared Source?</button>
      <div class="faq__panel">
        <p class="faq__answer">
        Shared source is a software licensing concept that is more open than
        the proprietary approach to licensing but more restricted than the open
        source model. Under a shared source program license, authorized parties are
        granted full or partial access to source code. Typically, those granted access can
        view source code but cannot alter it for any commercial purpose. Some shared
        source programs allow only viewing of code; others allow non-commercial
        alteration and/or redistribution. Microsoft originated the shared source approach,

        which has since been adopted by other major industry players, including Hewlett-
        Packard and Sun Microsystems.
        <br><br>

        The shared source model offers fewer benefits than the open source model.
        It lacks, for example, the collaborative improvement process promoted by the open
        source approach. However, even the ability to view source code can be helpful.
        Shared source code can help developers ensure compatibility with existing
        programs and can make it easier to review source code for security purposes.
        Critics have described shared source as a marketing ploy and suggested that
        the approach could pose a threat to the purity of the open source model. In a paper
        called "Shared Source: A Dangerous Virus," the Open Source Initiative called
        Microsoft's shared source program "a trap for the unwary" and warned that
        developers who'd been exposed to it should be considered "contaminated" and not
        assigned to projects that were competitive with Microsoft products.

      <button class="faq__question">What is the Android operating system?</button>
      <div class="faq__panel">
        <p class="faq__answer">
          The Android OS was originally created by Android, Inc., which was bought
by Google in 2005. Google teamed up with other companies to form the Open
Handset Alliance (OHA), which has become responsible for the continued
development of the Android OS. <br><br>
Android's underlying kernel is based on Linux, but it has been customized
to suit Google's directions. There is no support for the GNU libraries and it does
not have a native X Windows system. Inside the Linux kernel are found drivers for
the display, camera, flash memory, keypad, WiFi and audio. The Linux kernel
serves as an abstraction between the hardware and the rest of the software on the
phone. It also takes care of core system services like security, memory management,
process management and the network stack.
The Android OS is designed for phones. Its many features include:
• Integrated browser, based on the open source WebKit engine <br>
• Optimized 2D and 3D graphics, multimedia and GSM connectivity <br>
• Bluetooth <br>
• EDGE <br>
• 3G <br>
• WiFi SQ Lite Camera GPS Compass Accelerometer <br><br>
Software developers who want to create applications for the Android OS
can download the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) for a specific version.
The SDK includes a debugger, libraries, an emulator, some documentation, sample

code and tutorials. For faster development, interested parties can use graphical
integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to write applications
in Java.

    <button class="faq__question">What is GDB and GCC?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        What is gdb?
It is a “GNU Debugger”. A debugger for several languages, including C and
C++. It allows you to inspect what the program is doing at a certain point during
execution. Errors like segmentation faults may be easier to find with the help of
gdb. Most computer systems have one or more debugging tools available. These
can save you a tremendous amount of time and frustration in the debugging process.
The tool available on almost all Unix systems is gdb. <br><br>
How to Use gdb: <br>
Easy to Learn: In my own debugging, I tend to use just a few gdb commands, only
four or five in all. So, you can learn gdb quite quickly. Later, if you wish, you can
learn some advanced commands. <br><br>
The Basic Strategy: A typical usage of gdb runs as follows: After starting up gdb,
we set breakpoints, which are places in the code where we wish execution to pause.
Each time gdb encounters a breakpoint, it suspends execution of the program at that
point, giving us a chance to check the values of various variables.
In some cases, when we reach a breakpoint, we will single step for a while
from that point onward, which means that gdb will pause after every line of source
code. This may be important, either to further pinpoint the location at which a
certain variable changes value, or in some cases to observe the flow of execution,
seeing for example which parts of if-then-else constructs are executed.

    <button class="faq__question">What is Linux and the GNU System?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,
        without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which
        is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware
        that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. <br><br>
        There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of
        the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates
        the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an
        essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in
        the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination
        with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux
        added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really
        distributions of GNU/Linux. <br><br>
        Many users do not understand the difference between the kernel, which is
        Linux, and the whole system, which they also call “Linux”. The ambiguous use of
        the name doesn't help people understand. These users often think that Linus
        Torvalds developed the whole operating system in 1991, with a bit of help. <br><br>
        Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel. But since they have
        generally heard the whole system called “Linux” as well, they often envisage a
        history that would justify naming the whole system after the kernel. For example,
        many believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing Linux, the kernel, its users
        looked around for other free software to go with it, and found that (for no particular
        reason) most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was already
        available. <br><br>
        Whether you use GNU/Linux or not, please don't confuse the public by
        using the name “Linux” ambiguously. Linux is the kernel, one of the essential major
        components of the system. The system as a whole is basically the GNU system,
        with Linux added. When you're talking about this combination, please call it
        “GNU/Linux”.

    <button class="faq__question">What is GitHub?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        GitHub, the easiest way for developers to write software together, has scaled
        into a collaboration of 5.8 million developers across more than 12 million
        repositories worldwide. GitHub worked with Fastly to customize their CDN set up,
        ensuring rapid and efficient delivery of their content. Fastly serves all static assets
        and sits in front of GitHub.com, Pages (their website hosting service), and
        raw.github.com. <br><br>
        Open Source Software (OSS) has been adopted not only for the personal
        purpose software products but also for core systems of companies and public
        institutions. It becomes indispensable for our society. In order to evolve and grow
        OSSs, it is important to acquire not only stakeholders but also contributors widely
        from outside. Especially, in the case of large OSS, a large number of contributors
        are needed. Therefore, it is extremely important to explore the acquisition
        mechanism of contributors. <br><br>
        In this research, we try to elucidate the mechanism by analyzing the OSS
        projects on GitHub. Although GitHub is an Internet hosting service aimed at
        supporting software collaborative development, there are many other uses that
        actually do not require contributors, such as free file storage or learning of version
        control system. To analyze collaborative software development projects, it is
        necessary to exclude projects other than the purpose.

    <button class="faq__question">What is LAMP?</button>
    <div class="faq__panel">
      <p class="faq__answer">
        LAMP is an open source Web development platform that uses Linux as the
        operating system, Apache as the Web server, MySQL as the relational database
        management system and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language.
        (Sometimes Perl or Python is used instead of PHP.) <br> <br>
        Because the platform has four layers, LAMP is sometimes referred to as a
        LAMP stack. Stacks can be built on different operating systems. Developers that
        use these tools with a Windows operating system instead of Linux are said to be
        using WAMP; with a Macintosh system, MAMP; and with a Solaris system, SAMP. <br><br>
        What is the LAMP Stack?
        The widely popular LAMP stack is a set of open source software used for
        web application development.
        For a web application to work smoothly, it has to include an operating
        system, a web server, a database, and a programming language. The name LAMP
        is an acronym of the following programs:
        • Linux Operating System <br>
        • Apache HTTP Server <br>
        • MySQL database management system <br>
        • PHP programming language <br> <br>
        Each represents an essential layer of the stack, and together they can create
        a database-driven and dynamic website.
        <br><br>
        Four Components of LAMP Stack <br>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>

        Linux is the operating system layer and the backbone of the LAMP stack.
        All the other components of the stack run on top of this foundation. You can
        efficiently manage the rest of the stack components on different operating systems
        such as Windows, macOS, and others. However, Linux has become the front-runner
        for web development not just because it is open-source, but also due to its
        flexibility, customization and easy to use technology.
        Also, the programming language and database management used in
        developing a website may dictate the platform you choose to build it on. PHP and
        MySQL are better suited for Linux. On the other hand, SQL, ASP.NET, and ASP
        work more efficiently on Windows. <br><br>
        <b>Apache</b> <br>
        Apache HTTP Server is a web server software that runs on top of the Linux

        operating system.
        It is the most widely used server, powering more than half of the websites
        on the internet. The role of the web server is to process requests and transmit
        information through the internet, using HTTP.
        An alternative to Apache is NGINX, a web server whose popularity has
        been continually increasing since 2008. Whether you go for one or the other
        depends on what kind of material you want to serve on a webpage, as well as the
        hosting.
        NGINX is a better choice for static content. When it comes to dynamic
        content, there is a minor difference in performance between the two. Also, Apache
        is commonly used by shared hosting users, whereas NGINX is mainly used for
        virtual private servers, dedicated hosting or cluster containers. <br><br>
        <b>MySQL</b> <br>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most prevalent query language out
        there. A query is what we call a request for information or data stored in your
        database table.
        MySQL earned its reputation as an acclaimed database system as it supports
        SQL and relational tables. By doing so, it makes it much easier to establish dynamic
        enterprise-level databases.
        Consider MySQL if you:
        • Need to change the content of your website often
        • Have a lot of user-contributed content
        • Rely on user feedback
        • Have a lot of content that needs to be stored and easily retrieved
        Another relational database management system that can be part of the
        LAMP platform is MariaDB. Both are quite similar, and MariaDB claims to be
        completely compatible with MySQL, allowing users to transfer their database
        without any complications or losses. Deciding between the two comes down to
        whether you feel more comfortable storing data with a large corporation (MySQL
        under the direction of Oracle Corp) or a completely open source solution
        (MariaDB). <br><br>
        <b>PHP</b><br>
        PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language which has the
        role of combining all the elements of the LAMP stack and allowing the website or
        web application to run efficiently. In short, when a visitor opens the webpage, the
        server processes the PHP commands and sends the results to the visitor’s browser.
        PHP is the fourth layer of the original stack because it interacts
        exceptionally well with MySQL. It is commonly used for web development because
        it is a dynamically typed language, making it fast and easy to work with. This
        feature may be especially appealing if you are a beginner. The reason why PHP is
        so convenient to use is that it can be embedded into HTML enabling to jump in and
        out of it as you wish.
        In the LAMP stack, the P can also refer to two other programming languages
        - Perl or Python. All three are simple, yet useful, dynamic tools for creating

        environments in which you can successfully develop applications. Nowadays, there
        is a wide variety of scripting languages to choose from, including JavaScript, Ruby,
        and many more.

    <button class="faq__question">What is Open Source Datababse Software?</button>
      <div class="faq__panel">
        <p class="faq__answer">
          Traditionally, databases have been proprietary tools provided by Oracle,
          IBM, Microsoft, and a number of other smaller vendors. Over recent years though,
          and especially for new projects, open source databases and database management
          tools have steadily grown in maturity and importance. In many cases, open-source
          database software includes both database software, and the database management
          tools needed to support the database. <br><br>
          As open-source databases become adopted by more and more companies
          for large-scale enterprise projects, there has been a concomitant rise in the
          availability of skilled DBAs, with extensive knowledge of these platforms to be
          able to assist with mission-critical deployments.
          In addition to the obvious cost savings, open source database software have
          largely reached feature parity with their proprietary cousins. The open-source
          model also allows for heavy customization and community development, which
          makes the software very flexible compared to proprietary database software.
          Training materials are also often provided for free by user communities.
          Open-Source Database Software Features & Capabilities
          Some of the most common features provided by open-source database
          software include:
          • Relational and Nonrelational Databases <br>
          • Support for Multiple Platforms <br>
          • Supports databases and database management <br>
          • Data Security <br>

          Pricing Information <br>
          All open-source database software options are available for free to
          businesses that can support them independently. That said, a number of open-source
          database options offer paid support, hosting, or monitoring. Pricing depends highly
          on which features are needed by the organization. <br><br>
          <b>MySQL</b> <br>
          MySQL is by far the most popular open-source database out there. Vendors
          often include it in software packages as the application database.
          Even Oracle's own Virtual Machine software runs on MySQL.
          MySQL is an open source relational database management system. It is

          frequently used in webapplications and is even one of the pillars in the LAMP open-
          source web application software stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python).

          Even websites created in WordPress or Drupal use it as their database. <br><br>
          <b>PostgreSQL</b> <br>
          Postgre SQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system
          that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely
          store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of Postgre SQL
          date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California
          at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.
          Postgre SQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture,
          reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the
          open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and
          innovative solutions. Postgre SQL runs on all major operating systems, has been
          ACID-compliant since 2001, and has powerful add-ons such as the popular Post
          GIS geospatial database extender. It is no surprise that Postgre SQL has become the
          open source relational database of choice for many people and organisations.
          Getting started with using Postgre SQL has never been easier - pick a project
          you want to build, and let Postgre SQL safely and robustly store your data. <br><br>
          <b>MariaDB Server</b> <br>
          MariaDB Server is one of the most popular database servers in the world.
          It's made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source.
          Notable users include Wikipedia, WordPress.com and Google.
          MariaDB turns data into structured information in a wide array of
          applications, ranging from banking to websites. Originally designed as enhanced,
          drop-in replacement for MySQL, MariaDB is used because it is fast, scalable and
          robust, with a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins and many other tools make
          it very versatile for a wide variety of use cases.
          MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it
          provides an SQL interface for accessing data. The latest versions of MariaDB also
          include GIS and JSON features.

      <button class="faq__question">What are the Open Source Development Tools?</button>
      <div class="faq__panel">
        <p class="faq__answer">
         <b>Docker </b> <br>

          The first and still most popular container technology, Docker's open-
          source containerization engine works with most of the products that follow, as well

          as many open-source tools. <br><br>
          <b>Docker Enterprise</b> <br>
          This set of extensions not only adds features to Docker, but also makes it
          possible for Docker (the company) to add commercial support. If you need a support
          matrix to know exactly which versions of what software are supported—and a
          phone number to call if things go wrong—then Docker Enterprise might be for you. <br><br>
          <b>CRI-O</b> <br>
          The first implementation of the Container Runtime Interface, CRI-O is an
          incredibly lightweight, open-source reference implementation. <br><br>
          <b>rktlet</b> <br>
          The aforementioned rkt, redesigned and retooled to use the CRI as rktlet,
          now has a set of supported tools and community to rival Docker.
          containerd
          A project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, containerd was an
          early container format. More recently the developers of containerd built a CRI
          plugin that lets Kubernetes run containerd in the same way it runs rktlet or CRI-O. <br><br>
          <b>Microsoft Containers</b> <br>
          Positioned as an alternative to Linux, Microsoft Containers can support
          Windows containers under very specific circumstances. They generally run in a true
          virtual machine and not in a cluster manager like Kubernetes.

      <button class="faq__question">What is Virtualization and Containerization?</button>
      <div class="faq__panel">
        <p class="faq__answer">
          <b>Virtualization</b> <br>
          Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using
          resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical
          machine's full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or
          environments. <br><br>
          In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual
          dedicated purposes. One is a mail server, another is a web server, and the last one
          runs internal legacy applications. Each server is being used at about 30% capacity—
          just a fraction of their running potential. But since the legacy apps remain important
          to your internal operations, you have to keep them and the third server that hosts
          them, right? <br><br>
          Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks
          on individual servers: 1 server, 1 operating system, 1 task. It wasn't easy to give 1
          server multiple brains. But with virtualization, you can split the mail server into 2
          unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the legacy apps can be migrated.
          It's the same hardware, you're just using more of it more efficiently. <br><br>
          Keeping security in mind, you could split the first server again so it could
          handle another task—increasing its use from 30%, to 60%, to 90%. Once you do
          that, the now empty servers could be reused for other tasks or retired altogether to
          reduce cooling and maintenance costs. <br><br>
          <b>Containerization</b> <br>
          Docker is a software platform for building applications based on
          containers — small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use
          of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another.
          While containers as a concept have been around for some time, Docker, an open
          source project launched in 2013, helped popularize the technology, and has helped
          drive the trend towards containerization and microservices in software development
          that has come to be known as cloud-native development.
          What are containers? <br><br>

          One of the goals of modern software development is to keep
          applications on the same host or cluster isolated from one another so they don't

          unduly interfere with each other's operation or maintenance. This can be difficult,
          thanks to the packages, libraries, and other software components required for them
          to run. One solution to this problem has been virtual machines, which keep
          applications on the same hardware entirely separate, and reduce conflicts among
          software components and competition for hardware resources to a minimum. But
          virtual machines are bulky—each requires its own OS, so is typically gigabytes in
          size—and difficult to maintain and upgrade. <br><br>

          Containers, by contrast, isolate applications' execution environments
          from one another, but share the underlying OS kernel. They're typically measured
          in megabytes, use far fewer resources than VMs, and start up almost immediately.
          They can be packed far more densely on the same hardware and spun up and down
          en masse with far less effort and overhead. Containers provide a highly efficient
          and highly granular mechanism for combining software components into the kinds
          of application and service stacks needed in a modern enterprise, and for keeping
          those software components updated and maintained.
